                I'm Riley Smith and i'm currently studying entrepreneurial <br>management 
                at Brigham Young University. I've always loved <br>the automotive industry 
                but the racing in particular is what is <br>most exciting to me. When I was 
                18 I bought the Mustang <br>pictured to the left and I started modifying it to 
                race. After finding <br>much succes in going fast and hearing multiple 
                people take <br>interest in the parts on my car, which I designed and built<br> 
                myself, I decided to open up RS Performance and mass <br>produce the parts 
                that have made me so successful. I still <br>own the car today and the items 
                you see on this website are <br>parts that I still use. I hate doing things 
                twice so we've done <br>our best to develop high quality speed parts that will 
                last so <br>you won't be last.
